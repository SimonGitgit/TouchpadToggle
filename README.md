Lenovo X1 Extreme has no touchpad on/off shortcut key.

Make a simple exe to do so.

You may bind the exe to any key you want to mimick the shortcut key.

I have tested to change the DWORD in regedit but it won't work.

No event to control touchpad on/off either.

Don't ask why I build this stupid program,

ask why there are still notebook without the touchpad on/off shortcut key.

Anyway enjoy!
